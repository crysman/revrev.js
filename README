##revrevrev-erse your text!
- - -
revrevrev.js is a mostly pointless jQuery plugin that lets you style your text in some cool ways. like, you can flip the letters horizontally so that they rev-rev-reverse. and there are other things, too... random caps, random spacing, random colors, random heights!

    <p data-revrev="string"
       data-revrev-cray="10"
       data-revrev-clrz="red, #111, teal, purple"
       data-revrev-also="colorize"
    >all of this text gets owned by revrev!</p>
